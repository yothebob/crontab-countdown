 Where I left off:
    I made functions for...
        - opening and reading the crontab commands
        - extracting the function from time stamps
        - creating a dict for each function in form of {"function": [min,hour,dom,month,dow]}
        - small function for getting a dict key from an index number
        - started terminal ui (probably not perminant.. Flask or tkinter???)

To pick up on:
    - I need to figure out the datetime and how i am going to convert that and compare to real time



to do:
    - test it with a real crontab file and not just a txt file
    - create a class with functions built in, put a main function in the program


would be nice:
    - maybe make a better interface...
    - can I make it real time updating?



now = datetime.now()
            current_times = [now.minute,now.hour,now.day,now.month,now.weekday()]
            max_day = calendar.monthrange(now.year,now.month)
            max_times = [59,23,max_day[1],12,6]

            for key, values in functions.items():
                print("\n"*2,f"Key : {key} ")
                for number in range(len(values)):
                    converted_time = self.convert_crontab_time(values[number],current_times[number])
                    self.find_next_run_time(converted_time,current_times[number],max_times[number])
