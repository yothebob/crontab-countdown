 Where I left off:
    I made functions for...
        - opening and reading the crontab commands
        - extracting the function from time stamps
        - creating a dict for each function in form of {"function": [min,hour,dom,month,dow]}
        - small function for getting a dict key from an index number
        - started terminal ui (probably not perminant.. Flask or tkinter???)


would be nice:
    - maybe make a better interface...
    - can I make it real time updating?
